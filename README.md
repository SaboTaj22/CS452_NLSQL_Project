# CS452_NLSQL_Project

### Overview
 - This project integrates a SQLite database with OpenAI's GPT to generate SQL queries based on natural language prompts, specifically focused on stock trading data. It evaluates different prompting strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, to analyze trading performance. The system provides insights into winning and losing trades, trader performance, and stock activity. The results of these queries are logged in JSON files for further analysis.
